# this app will allow the user to compare the relative positional value
# of a fantasy player against the relative positional value of 
# other available players
# relative positional value is the points above the average starter
# at the player's position. this comp is used because different positions
# have different starting requirements and varying amounts of quality players
# for example, QBs tend to all produce at a high level, while there are only
# 2-3 tight ends that produce at a high level
# knowing the right time to select a high quality player at one position
# over the other depends on how much the player adds to your expected team 
# points relative to other available players and the stock of those players
# "stock" meaning the quality of all available players, not just the best available
# because the "best" available will likely still not be available at the next pick
# so its important to know what quality of position is likely to be available
